				<p>This website is "UNDER CONSTRUCTION" for my digital portfolio, for lack of a better term. I therefore consider it to be stand in. Hence why you see the block falling apart on the main page followed by a python error message. The site showcases both my digital art such as VFX work I've done on short films, 3D models, digital paintings, and ect. It also showcases my computer programming projects which
				 occasionally tie into my work with digital art.</p>
				<p>Absolutely everything in this website was created by yours truely, unless otherwise stated. That includes the HTML for this webpage and all images/videos it contains. Although the HTML is certainly subpar because I have very little experience with it.</p>
				<p>If you're confused as to why my website looks like a NES game the answer is that it is designed to look like Python code in a code editor called Sublime Text.</p>

				<p>jos.ai is a word play on my real name [Josiah] and A.I.[artificial intelligence]. Which I figured fits perfectly for a thematical website such as this.</p>
				<p>I started creating stop motion animations when I was around 7 years old with legos. Eventually that evolved into film making and digital art such as 3D modeling and animation. I'm now 23 and have over 10 years of experience with computer animation. My work has been featured on websites such as the blender artist forum and even as far as the vanity fair[website]! And of course several short films I've been involved in creating VFX for have went and even won at film festivals around the world.</p>
				<p>My main talent is probably for digital FX. Although given the nature of working on small scale projects you end up wearing many hats. So I have helped to produce projects as well. That said in 2016 I decided to take the plunge and start teaching myself programming to really push my skills to the next level. Python is currently the langauge I have the most experience in although I've dabbled with HTML and SQL. I chose to start with Python for the obivious reason that it is used as a scripting language for Blender 3D.</p>
